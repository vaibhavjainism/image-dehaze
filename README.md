# Image Dehazing by U-net Model
This repository implements an image-to-image translation task using U-Net and convolutional autoencoders. The project converts hazy images to clear images through deep learning techniques, trained on a dataset for effective dehazing. It showcases the application of neural networks in image enhancement tasks.
## Dataset
